Since in Germany wasps get very annoying, I decided to test some wasp traps here. I tested a view but was finally not very lucky about them. So i decided to do my own based on best practice.

This is a remixed version of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1000336

Improvements have been:

fast printing time
big wasp bag
proofed concept for wasps to enter, however, from the old design, the wasps have been able to frequently leave the trap again. So I changed the channels for the wasps to enter to make it more likly for the wasp to be trapped.
The trap is easy to use and clean.

I tested my trap with Glass filament, but due to this it was not very sealed and I encountered a leak. Please report if you use usual PLA / ABS of the material wall thickness is sufficient to be sealed.

You should take some beer and sugar to put it into the trap from the above opening.
Once the wasps are dead, you can easy clean it by flooding it with water.

I also included some pictures from original design (red color print in photo) and improved version (V1) (glass filament color).
While I know, V3 is even performing by far better then V1.

All traps have been at the same place for 24 hours, the same amount of beer+sugar and checked after wasps died.

Have fun!
