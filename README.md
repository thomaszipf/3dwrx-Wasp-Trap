# 3dwrx-Wasp-Trap

## The purpose of 3dwrx-Wasp-Trap
If you live in an area which has a lot of wasps, you don't need an explanation how I got my inspiration for this design. 
Wasps can be really annoying in Germany, so I decided to make my life a little bit easier with this Wasp Trap. 
The design that you can see here is actually an improved design from my first idea.

## What are the core features?
- Core function of this design is to keep annoying wasps away.

Improvements since the latest design change:
- faster printing time
- bigger wasp bag
- changed path of wasps which leads to better chance of having the wasps in the trap
- doesn't allow wasps to leave the trap 
- easy to use and clean.

I tested my trap with Glass filament, but due to this it was not very sealed and I encountered a leak. Please report if you use usual PLA / ABS of the material wall thickness is sufficient to be sealed.

## How to setup:
Take beer and sugar and put it into the trap, right above the opening. 
Please don't open the trap when there are living wasps inside. Once the wasps are dead you can easily clean it by just flooding it with water.
